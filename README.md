# OPT-mini-project

This is the folder to solve all Mini-Projects for the fundamental optimizations class 144218 <br>
Mapped for class 144217 to 144218:
  * 1=13 -> 11
  * 2 -> 7
  * 3 -> 9
  * 4 -> 4
  * 5 -> 2
  * 7 -> 16
  * 8 -> 13
  * 9 -> 5
  * 14 -> 12
  * 15 -> 10
  * 17 -> 15
  * 18 -> 1
  * 20 -> 14
  * 23 -> 8
  * 24 = 25 -> 3
  * 26 -> 6

Note that not all Problems in class 144218 are the same as in class 144217, please check carefully.

All solutions just use some basic Heuristic Algorithm and GA. Most of them are not exact or maybe not even close to the optimal solutions, some of them are indeed exact Algorithms but need to be proven. Use for reference only.

About the 1st and 2nd Projects, the checker of the website is BUG so I have not posted my submit code for those yet.
And about the 3rd and 14th Projects, there is a BUG that if your solution is better than the web, you'll get full points but if not, it'll raise an Invalid Response message
