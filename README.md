# OPT-mini-project

This is the folder to solve all Mini-Projects for the fundamental optimizations class 144218 and 144217.

All solutions just use some basic Heuristic Algorithm and GA. Most of them are not exact or maybe not even close to the optimal solutions, some of them are indeed exact Algorithms but need to be proven. Use for reference only.

About the 1st and 2nd Projects, the checker of the website is BUG so I have not posted my submited code for those yet.

And about the 3rd and 9th Projects (and maybe more :> ), there is a BUG that if your solution is better than the web, you'll get full points but if not, it'll raise an Invalid Response message, so don't worry that your code is not work, it just that your solution to some task is not surpass the web's solution.
